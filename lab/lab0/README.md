# Laboratory 0: Introduction to Python and Scientific Computing

This laboratory introduces the basics of Python programming and essential scientific libraries for numerical methods in the geosciences. The lab is structured around three main Jupyter notebooks:

---

## 1. `intro.ipynb` — Introduction to Python Programming

- **Python syntax and program structure:** How to write and run Python scripts, use comments, and execute code from the command line.
- **Modules and imports:** Using the Python Standard Library and importing modules.
- **Variables and types:** Dynamic typing, assignment, and type casting.
- **Operators and comparisons:** Arithmetic, boolean, and comparison operators.
- **Compound types:** Strings, lists, tuples, and dictionaries, including indexing and slicing.
- **Control flow:** Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) and loops (`for`, `while`).
- **Functions:** Defining and calling functions, docstrings, return values, default and keyword arguments, lambda functions.
- **List comprehensions:** Compact ways to create lists.
- **Exercises:** Practice problems on basic Python programming, including functions for even numbers, multiplication, Pascal's triangle, primality, and factorials.

## 2. `numpy.ipynb` — Numpy: Multidimensional Data Arrays

- **Introduction to Numpy:** Efficient array operations for numerical computing.
- **Array creation:** From lists, using functions (`arange`, `linspace`, `logspace`, `mgrid`, random generators), and reading from files.
- **Array properties:** Shape, size, data type, memory usage.
- **Indexing and slicing:** Accessing and modifying elements, rows, columns, and subarrays; fancy indexing and boolean masks.
- **Array manipulation:** Reshaping, flattening, stacking, repeating, and concatenating arrays.
- **File I/O:** Reading and writing arrays in CSV and Numpy's native formats.
- **Linear algebra:** Element-wise operations, matrix multiplication, dot products, solving linear systems, determinants, eigenvalues/eigenvectors, and condition numbers.
- **Advanced indexing:** Using `where`, `diag`, `take`, and `choose`.
- **Vectorization:** Writing efficient, vectorized code instead of loops.
- **Data processing:** Statistical functions (mean, std, var, min, max, sum, prod, trace).
- **Exercises:** Practical tasks on missing values, Hilbert matrices, and eigenvalue algorithms.

## 3. `matplotlib.ipynb` — Matplotlib: 2D and 3D Plotting

- **Introduction to Matplotlib:** Creating scientific figures and plots.
- **Plotting APIs:** MATLAB-like and object-oriented interfaces.
- **Basic plotting:** Line plots, subplots, figure size, DPI, saving figures.
- **Decorating plots:** Titles, axis labels, legends, LaTeX formatting, font settings.
- **Customizing appearance:** Colors, line styles, markers, axis ranges, logarithmic scales, tick placement, scientific notation.
- **Advanced features:** Grids, axis spines, twin axes, axes at zero, annotations.
- **Multiple subplots and insets:** Using `subplots`, `subplot2grid`, `gridspec`, and manual axes.
- **Colormaps and contours:** `pcolor`, `imshow`, `contour` for 2D data visualization.
- **3D plotting:** Surface, wireframe, and contour plots in 3D, changing view angles, quiver plots.
- **Histograms and scatter plots:** Additional plot types for data exploration.
